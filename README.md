##  📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Univariate analysis**:

`salary` → examine distribution and detect outliers
`experience_level` → analyze frequency and trends
`company_size` → check distributions across company sizes
`employment_type` → explore distribution of employment types

**Outlier detection**:
`salary` → identify unusually high/low values and investigate validity

**Bivariate relationships**:
`salary` vs `experience_level` → explore correlations
`salary` vs `remote_ratio` → analyze impact of remote work
`salary` vs `company_size` → check pay differences across company sizes

**Geographic insights**:
`employee_residence` → map average salaries by country/region
`company_location` → compare pay across company locations

**Time trends**:
`year` → track evolution of salaries and number of salary reports over time
